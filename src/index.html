        <h2>Safety incidents at private psychiatric hospitals in Washington State, 2016-2018</h2>
        <p>Hospitals in Washington state are required to report “adverse events” –  when patients or staff suffer serious, largely preventable harm in certain circumstances – to the Department of Health. At private psychiatric hospitals, the vast majority of safety incidents aren’t reported as adverse events, even when they cause serious injury or are referred for prosecution, according to a review of public records by The Seattle Times. Some incidents, such as escapes that don’t result in serious injury, likely wouldn’t meet the criteria for reporting but represent near-miss events.</p>
